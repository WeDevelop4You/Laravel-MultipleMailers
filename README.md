# Laravel Multiple Mailers

I made this package because I wanted to use multiple mails. it is a small simple package to use multiple mails in Laravel. I'm not really going to expand it any further. only if I want to add functions myself. you are free to use the package and here is a little explanation of how to use it.

## Installation
PHP 7.0 or higher and tested on Laravel 7 are required.

Require this package with composer.

`composer require wedevelop4you/laravel-multiple-mailers`

Publish the config file by running:

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="WeDevelop4You\LaravelMultipleMailers\Providers\MailerServiceProvider" --tag=config`
